Problem title: ASCII Passcode

# Assessment Objectives
1. Apply C++ syntax rules for computational operations involving various variable types
2. Formulate C++ code that can perform basic analysis tasks on data values of different variable types

# Problem Description

Create a C++ program that takes in three characters (letters, digits, or symbols) from the keyboard. Next, based on the ASCII decimal value of the three characters (denoted as AASCII, BASCII, and CASCII), determine an 8-9 digit passcode according to the following rule:

<pre>
passcode = 1000000 * A<sub>ASCII</sub> + 1000 * B<sub>ASCII</sub> + C<sub>ASCII</sub>
</pre>

Display the passcode on the screen at the end of the program. If you have written your source code correctly, your screen output should look like the following for a given input Doe:

<pre>
Enter three characters consecutively without space: Doe
The corresponding passcode is: 68111101
</pre>

## Submission

You should submit the result of this exercise to the project 150-1-ASCII. Your submission file must be named passcode.cpp (case sensitive).
